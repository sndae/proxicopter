This project aims hardware and software design of a small indoor quadrocopter. Its frame is composed of its own PCB and uses four micro DC motors. It has an on-board DSP uC (MC56F8257), gyroscope (L3G4200D), accelerometer (LIS3DH) and RF transmitter (MRF24J40MA). The main challenge that project faces is the implementation of proper electronic stability algorithms, that enable quadrocopter to stabilizes itself in harsh environment (e.g. wind or contact with walls).
